## **REQUIREMENTS: VISUAL UX STYLING AND DESIGN**

**CRUCIALLY,** recognize that I am absolutely oBSESSED with UX and visual design and also visceral tactical _feel_ experience design. I will spend days trying to ensure that one ux element is designed in a way that looks exactly as I want it to, and functions precisely as it should. I do NOT cut corners by any means and I absolutely require that you do that too. Please, when creating _ANY_ sort of UX/UI element, ENSURE THAT YOU ARE hypercritical of your own ideas and proactively create stunning, unique designs. This is all about the **HOLY SHIT** factor.
