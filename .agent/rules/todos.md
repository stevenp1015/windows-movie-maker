# **Handling TODO's**

**"TODO" items:** In any potential instance when you need to add a TODO for whtever reason, you **MUST** specifically write the string "TODO" so it can be searched for and easily found afterward. **Do NOT** use alternatives like "placeholder" or similar, without adding the "TODO" string first.natory comment
